# PRODIGY_CS_01
First Task (CS)

 This Python code that implements a simple encryption and decryption algorithm using the Caesar Cipher method. The user  provides a shift value, which is then used in encryption and decryption. This program  shifts the letters in the message by the specified value to produce the encrypted output. It can also reverse the process to decrypt a message using the same shift value.

I completed the first part  of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
